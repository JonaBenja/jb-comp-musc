#### Acoustic versus electronic singer-songwriters

*This assignment will be about the differences and similarities between electronic and acoustic singer-songwriters. Acoustic and electronic music are a world apart, but it seems now that they can be closer than expected, by the fact that both acoustic and electronic singer-songwriters exist. I define acoustic singer-songwriters as 1 or max. 2 people that sing and play exclusively on 1 acoustic instrument, mainly guitar of piano. Examples are Passenger and  Electronic singer-songwriters are to me people who produce their own music containing (not neccesarily but also not limited to) synthesizers, looping stations or drums computers, and are able to perform it live. The music must contain roughly the same amount of singing as the acoustic songs. Examples are Chet Faker and JAIN.* 

#### Corpusses
There are two corpusses that will be compared. These are Spotify playlists. For the acoustic singer-songwriters, a playlist generated by Spotify was chosen that was called: "Acoustic Singer-songwriters". The playlist was checked manually and all the songs satisfied the criteria stated above. This corpus represents the acoustic singer songwriters pretty well.
The playlist for the electronic singer-songwriters was made by a Spotify user and complemented by me.  It contains many songs that fulfull the criteria from above, but also more songs that belong to the Indie genre, with lots of electric guitars, but no electronic instruments. This playlist does not totally represent the playlist needed to execute this research, but I am planning on adjusting it manually.
