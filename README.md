#### Acoustic versus electronic singer-songwriters

*This assignment will be about the differences and similarities between electronic and acoustic singer-songwriters. Acoustic and electronic music are a world apart, but it seems now that they can be closer than expected, by the fact that both acoustic and electronic singer-songwriters exist. I define acoustic singer-songwriters as 1 or max. 2 people that sing and play exclusively on 1 acoustic instrument, mainly guitar of piano. Examples are Passenger and  Electronic singer-songwriters are to me people who produce their own music containing (not neccesarily but also not limited to) synthesizers, looping stations or drums computers, and are able to perform it live. The music must contain roughly the same amount of singing as the acoustic songs. Examples are Chet Faker and JAIN.* 

#### Corpusses
There are two corpusses that will be compared. These are Spotify playlists. For the acoustic singer-songwriters, a playlist generated by Spotify was chosen that was called: "Acoustic Singer-songwriters". The playlist was checked manually and all the songs satisfied the criteria stated above. This corpus represents the acoustic singer songwriters pretty well.
The playlist for the electronic singer-songwriters was made by a Spotify user and complemented by me.  It contains many songs that fulfull the criteria from above, but also more songs that belong to the Indie genre, with lots of electric guitars, but no electronic instruments. This playlist does not totally represent the playlist needed to execute this research, but I am planning on adjusting it manually. 

#### Interesting findings
The biggest differences in the quick analysis are the energy, acousticness and instrumentalness. The electronic playlist has more energy (mean =  0.527, SD = 0.180), acoustic (mean = 0.392, SD = 0.166). The minimal energy of the electrononic songs is 0.112, twice as high as the acoustic value: 0.0577. 

The next variable to be compared is acousticness. The acoustic playlisy has a higher acousticness, which makes a lot of sense. Acoustic: mean = 0.646, SD = 0.268. Electronic: mean = 0.411, SD = 0.292. The difference is not as big as one would expect though. 

Lastly, the instrumentalness. The acoustic playlist has a very low instrumentalness (mean = 0.0360 SD = 0.114) which is perfectly logical. The instrumentallness of the electronic playlist is a bit higher, but still pretty low (mean = 0.121     , SD = 0.240).

The acoustic playlisy has 33 minor songs, in a total of 471 songs. That's about 7%. The electronic playlist has 83 minor songs, in a total of 218 songs. With 38%, that's a lot more.

#### Extreme values
In the acoustic playliy, the song 'Seize the Night' by has the highest speechiness, 0.2260. The song below it has 0.1370. The rest of the differences is a lot smaller. 

In the electronic playlisy, the song My bed has the largest danceability (0.976), but the song is in my opinion pretty mellow. It sounds happy, and you could dance to it, but there sure are a lot of songs that sound more danceable to me. 

The song 'Monkeys in my Head' is the most danceable song in the acoustic playlist, 0.869, and sounds about the same as 'My Bed'. Apparently, Spotify and I have a different opnion on danceability. 

I do think that I should include the outliers. 

### Conclusion
The playlists are more alike than different, but it is inter
